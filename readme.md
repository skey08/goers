My idea is to have a way for concert goers to share photos of concerts they
have been to.  Initially someone will create a new post with an image of the
concert they were at, their name, the date and venue.  Then other users can post
additional pictures to the first post if they were at the same concert.

1. I frequently go to concerts and I want a way to share my pictures.
2. I want to look at concert pictures of bands that I am interested in.
3. I was at a concert and I want to share my pictures with other people that
were there.
4. I want to log in and have a record of concerts that I have been to.
5. I want to be able to send a link of the concert I was at with my friends, so
they can add pictures also.
6. I am an artist and I want to see pictures of my shows.
7. I am an artist and I want an easy way to promote my shows by linking to one
of my concert pages.

Users will have many concerts --- Concerts belong to users
Concerts will have many images --- Images belong to concerts
